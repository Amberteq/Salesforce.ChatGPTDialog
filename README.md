## About

ChatGPT dialog integration for your Salesforce application. Just install and communicate with ChatGPT models. You need an OpenAI paid account for using the package. Login to [www.openai.com](https://www.openai.com), create a paid account and get API KEY for the interaction. After you have API KEY - provide it in the Setup. Then you can chat with ChatGPT models without exiting your Salesforce application.
